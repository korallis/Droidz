# Droidz Configuration
# Spec-driven development with parallel execution for Droid CLI

# Profile to use (default includes planning, spec, implementation workflows)
profile: default

# Enable Droid CLI custom droids installation
install_droids: true

# Use Exa for research during planning and specification
# ENABLED: MCP tools are now available via custom droids
use_exa_research: true

# Use Ref for documentation lookup
# ENABLED: MCP tools are now available via custom droids
use_ref_docs: true

# MCP Tools Configuration
# All custom droids have access to comprehensive MCP tool integrations:
# - Linear: Issue tracking and project management
# - Exa: Web search and code context research
# - Ref: Documentation search (public and private)
# - code-execution: Execute TypeScript for MCP interactions
# - desktop-commander: Advanced file/process operations
mcp_tools_enabled: true

# Parallel execution settings (CORE FEATURE - DO NOT DISABLE)
# This is what makes Droidz 3-5x faster than sequential AI development
parallel:
  enabled: true  # REQUIRED: Keep this true to enable parallel workers
  max_concurrent_tasks: 5  # DEFAULT: 5 workers (Range: 2-10)
                          # Increase to 8-10 for large features with many independent tasks
                          # Decrease to 2-3 only if tasks are tightly coupled
  workspace_mode: worktree  # RECOMMENDED: worktree (enables true parallel execution)
                           # worktree = isolated git working trees (fastest, safest)
                           # clone = full repo copies (slower, more disk space)
                           # branch = shadow copies (no git isolation, use as last resort)
                           # ALWAYS use 'worktree' unless git worktrees are not supported

# Standards enforcement

  enforce_before_implementation: true
