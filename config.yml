# Droidz Configuration
# Spec-driven development with parallel execution for Droid CLI

# Profile to use (default includes planning, spec, implementation workflows)
profile: default

# Enable Droid CLI custom droids installation
install_droids: true

# Use Exa for research during planning and specification
# ENABLED: MCP tools are now available via custom droids
use_exa_research: true

# Use Ref for documentation lookup
# ENABLED: MCP tools are now available via custom droids
use_ref_docs: true

# MCP Tools Configuration
# All custom droids have access to comprehensive MCP tool integrations:
# - Linear: Issue tracking and project management
# - Exa: Web search and code context research
# - Ref: Documentation search (public and private)
# - code-execution: Execute TypeScript for MCP interactions
# - desktop-commander: Advanced file/process operations
mcp_tools_enabled: true

# Linear Integration (Optional - for automated ticket processing)
# Get your API key from: https://linear.app/settings/api
# Get your team ID from your Linear workspace URL or API
linear:
  api_key: "${LINEAR_API_KEY}"  # Use environment variable for security
  team_id: ""  # Your Linear team ID (e.g., "abc123def456")
  update_comments: true  # Post PR links as comments on tickets
  auto_status_updates: true  # Automatically update ticket status

# Parallel execution settings (CORE FEATURE - DO NOT DISABLE)
# This is what makes Droidz 3-5x faster than sequential AI development
parallel:
  enabled: true  # REQUIRED: Keep this true to enable parallel workers
  max_concurrent_tasks: 5  # DEFAULT: 5 workers (Range: 2-10)
                          # Increase to 8-10 for large features with many independent tasks
                          # Decrease to 2-3 only if tasks are tightly coupled

# Git workspace configuration
workspace:
  base_dir: ".runs"  # Directory for isolated workspaces
  branch_pattern: "feature/{issueKey}-{slug}"  # Branch naming pattern
  mode: worktree  # RECOMMENDED: worktree (enables true parallel execution)
              # worktree = isolated git working trees (fastest, safest)
              # clone = full repo copies (slower, more disk space)
              # branch = shadow copies (no git isolation, use as last resort)
              # ALWAYS use 'worktree' unless git worktrees are not supported

# Safety guardrails
guardrails:
  tests_required: true  # Require tests to pass before PRs
  secret_scan: true  # Scan for secrets before commits
  lint_on_change: false  # Run linter on changed files

# Standards enforcement
standards:
  enforce_before_implementation: true
  auto_inject_into_prompts: true
