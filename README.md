## What Is Droidz?

Droidz is a Claude Code framework that enables **parallel task execution** through isolated git worktrees, **spec-driven development** for clarity before coding, and **specialist agents** for domain expertise.

### Core Capabilities

✅ **Spec-Driven Workflow** - Write clear specifications before implementation
✅ **True Parallel Execution** - Isolated git worktrees + tmux for concurrent tasks
✅ **7 Specialist Agents** - Domain experts (codegen, test, refactor, infra, etc.)
✅ **Persistent Memory** - Context, decisions, and patterns persist across sessions
✅ **Supervised Autonomy** - Human approval at key checkpoints
✅ **Dependency Tracking** - Phased execution respects task dependencies

---

## Quick Start

### Windows Users: WSL2 Setup (First Time Only)

If you're on Windows and don't have WSL2 installed yet:

```powershell
# Run in PowerShell as Administrator
wsl --install

# Reboot your computer

# After reboot, set default to WSL2
wsl --set-default-version 2

# Install Ubuntu (or your preferred distro)
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

# Launch Ubuntu and create your user account when prompted
```

Then continue with the installation steps below from within your WSL2 terminal.

### One-Line Installation

**macOS Users**:
```bash
# Install dependencies first
brew install git jq tmux

# Then install Droidz (from your project directory)
cd your-project && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/korallis/Droidz/Claude-Code/install-claude-code.sh | bash
```

**Windows/WSL2 Users**:
```bash
# Install dependencies first
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git jq tmux

# Then install Droidz (from your project directory)
cd your-project && curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/korallis/Droidz/Claude-Code/install-claude-code.sh | bash
```

The installer will:
- ✅ Detect your OS automatically
- ✅ Verify prerequisites (git, jq, tmux)
- ✅ Install framework to `.claude/`
- ✅ Copy documentation (README.md, QUICK_START.md)
- ✅ Configure .gitignore
- ✅ Verify all files present

**Setup time**: 1-2 minutes

### First Time Setup

After installation, initialize Droidz:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Run initialization wizard
/droidz-init
```

The initialization wizard will:
- ✅ Check dependencies
- ✅ Create directory structure
- ✅ Initialize memory system
- ✅ Verify orchestration engine

## How It Works

### Traditional Sequential Workflow

```
User Request: "Build authentication system"
  ↓
Backend API (4 hours)
  ↓
Frontend UI (3 hours)
  ↓
Tests (2 hours)
  ↓
Total: 9 hours sequential
```

### Droidz Parallel Workflow

```
User Request: "Build authentication system"
  ↓
Create Specification (/create-spec)
  ↓
Generate Tasks (/spec-to-tasks)
  ↓
Orchestrate (/orchestrate):
  ├─ Backend API (4h)    ← Worktree 1 + droidz-codegen
  ├─ Frontend UI (3h)    ← Worktree 2 + droidz-codegen
  └─ Tests (2h)          ← Worktree 3 + droidz-test
  ↓
Integration & Merge (1h)
  ↓
Total: 5 hours (1.8x faster)
```

### The Key Difference

**Git Worktrees** - Each task gets its own isolated workspace with:
- Separate branch
- Independent file system
- No merge conflicts during execution
- Parallel development without interference

**Tmux Sessions** - Monitor all tasks simultaneously:
- Each task in its own terminal session
- Real-time progress tracking
- Easy to attach and inspect

---

## Core Features

### 1. Spec-Driven Development

Create clear specifications before coding:

```bash
# Create feature specification
/create-spec feature user-authentication

# Validate completeness
/validate-spec .claude/specs/active/user-authentication.md

# Generate task breakdown
/spec-to-tasks .claude/specs/active/user-authentication.md
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear requirements eliminate rework
- Better task decomposition
- Built-in acceptance criteria
- Documentation created automatically

### 2. Parallel Orchestration

Execute independent tasks simultaneously:

```bash
# Start orchestration from tasks JSON
/orchestrate file:user-authentication-tasks.json

# Creates isolated worktrees:
# .runs/AUTH-BACKEND/  ← droidz-codegen specialist
# .runs/AUTH-FRONTEND/ ← droidz-codegen specialist
# .runs/AUTH-TESTS/    ← droidz-test specialist

# Each in its own tmux session
# Monitor: tmux attach -t droidz-AUTH-BACKEND
```

**What gets created**:
- Git worktree for each task (isolated workspace)
- Git branch for each task (feat/TASK-KEY-description)
- Tmux session for each task (monitoring)
- Coordination state file (progress tracking)

### 3. Specialist Agents

7 domain-expert agents, each with specific tools and expertise:

| Agent | Specialty | Tools | When Used |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| `droidz-codegen` | Feature implementation | Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob | New features, bug fixes |
| `droidz-test` | Testing & quality | Read, Write, Edit, Bash | Test suites, coverage |
| `droidz-refactor` | Code improvement | Read, Write, Edit, Grep | Cleanup, optimization |
| `droidz-infra` | CI/CD & tooling | Read, Write, Edit, Bash | Pipelines, configs |
| `droidz-integration` | External services | Read, Write, Edit, Bash | APIs, webhooks |
| `droidz-orchestrator` | Coordination | Read, Bash, Task | Multi-task orchestration |
| `droidz-generalist` | General tasks | Read, Write, Edit, Bash | Fallback, misc |

Agents are assigned per task in your specification.

### 4. Persistent Memory

Context persists across sessions in structured JSON files:

**Organization Memory** (`.claude/memory/org/`):
- `decisions.json` - Architectural decisions
- `patterns.json` - Code patterns and conventions
- `tech-stack.json` - Technology configuration

**User Memory** (`.claude/memory/user/`):
- `preferences.json` - User preferences
- `context.json` - Session state and active orchestrations

**Example**:
```json
{
  "id": "DEC-001",
  "title": "Use PostgreSQL for Database",
  "date": "2025-01-12",
  "decision": "PostgreSQL 15 with PgBouncer connection pooling",
  "rationale": "Need ACID compliance and complex query support",
  "status": "accepted"
}
```

### 5. Auto-Activating Skills

Three skills that trigger automatically based on context:

**spec-shaper** - Transforms fuzzy ideas into clear specifications
- Triggers: Incomplete requirements, vague requests
- Guides through requirements gathering
- Creates comprehensive specs

**auto-orchestrator** - Recommends parallelization for complex work
- Triggers: Multiple distinct tasks, complex systems
- Analyzes dependencies
- Suggests parallel execution plan

**memory-manager** - Auto-persists decisions and patterns
- Triggers: Architectural decisions, pattern establishment
- Saves to appropriate memory files
- Makes context available to future sessions

---

## Realistic Expectations

### What Droidz DOES ✅

- Structures complex projects with specifications
- Enables parallel development via git worktrees
- Routes tasks to specialist agents
- Maintains persistent memory across sessions
- Tracks dependencies and coordinates execution
- Provides supervised workflow with approval gates

### What Droidz DOESN'T DO ❌

- Fully autonomous coding (you approve plans)
- Replace human developers (augments them)
- Auto-execute without supervision
- Guarantee specific speedups (depends on parallelizability)
- Magically fix all conflicts (you review merges)

### Realistic Performance

| Scenario | Sequential | With Droidz | Speedup |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Single feature | 4 hours | 4 hours | 1x (no benefit) |
| Feature + tests | 7 hours | 5 hours | 1.4x |
| Full-stack feature | 12 hours | 6 hours | 2x |
| Microservice | 20 hours | 10 hours | 2x |
| Sprint (10 tickets) | 80 hours | 30 hours | 2.7x |

**Average**: 1.5-2.5x speedup for parallelizable work

**Best for**:
- Multiple independent tasks
- Clear task boundaries
- Well-defined acceptance criteria
- Full-stack features with frontend + backend + tests

**Not helpful for**:
- Single linear tasks
- Highly dependent sequential work
- Exploratory/research work
- Rapid prototyping

## Typical Workflow

### Simple Feature (No Parallelization Needed)

```
User: "Add dark mode toggle to the header"

→ Claude implements directly (single file, simple change)
→ Time: 5-10 minutes
→ Skills still help: memory-manager saves pattern
```

### Complex Feature (Parallel Execution)

```
User: "Build authentication with OAuth and JWT"

→ spec-shaper activates: guides through requirements
→ Creates comprehensive spec
→ /spec-to-tasks generates task breakdown
→ auto-orchestrator recommends parallel execution
→ /orchestrate creates worktrees and executes
→ memory-manager saves architectural decisions

Time: ~30 minutes instead of 75 minutes (2.5x faster)
```

### Orchestration Flow

1. **Parse Tasks** - From JSON, spec file, or Linear query
2. **Analyze Dependencies** - Build execution phases
3. **Create Worktrees** - Isolated git workspace per task
4. **Spawn Tmux Sessions** - Monitoring per task
5. **Coordinate Execution** - Track progress, logs
6. **Integration** - Merge completed work
7. **Cleanup** - Remove worktrees, kill sessions

---

## Monitoring

### View Active Orchestrations
```bash
/orchestrate list
```

### View Tmux Sessions
```bash
tmux list-sessions | grep droidz
```

### Attach to Task
```bash
tmux attach -t droidz-TASK-KEY
```

### View Coordination State

```

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do This

- Create detailed specs for complex features
- Let auto-orchestrator recommend parallelization
- Review orchestration plans before executing
- Use specialist agents for their expertise
- Archive completed specs
- Query memory for past decisions

### ❌ Avoid This

- Skipping specs for complex work
- Force-parallelizing dependent tasks
- Ignoring dependency warnings
- Running too many concurrent orchestrations
- Leaving worktrees around after completion

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dependencies Missing
```bash
# Install required tools
brew install git jq tmux

# Verify installation
/droidz-init --status
```

### Orchestration Won't Start
```bash
# Ensure git repo is clean
git status

# Check for existing worktrees
git worktree list
```

### Memory Not Persisting
```bash
# Check file permissions
ls -la .claude/memory/org/
ls -la .claude/memory/user/
```

### Worktrees Not Cleaning Up
```bash
# Manual cleanup
git worktree prune

# Or use orchestrator cleanup
/orchestrate cleanup:SESSION_ID
```
