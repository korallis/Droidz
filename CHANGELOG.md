# Changelog

All notable changes to Droidz will be documented in this file.

## [3.1.3] - 2025-11-22

### 🔧 Hotfix

**Fixed Installer 404 Error**
- ✅ Fixed installer trying to download `droidz-build.md` (now `build.md`)
- ✅ Added missing validation commands to installer (`validate-init.md`, `validate.md`)
- ✅ All version numbers synchronized: install.sh, package.json, README, tag
- ✅ Installer now downloads all correct command files
- ✅ v2.x migration works properly

**Installation command:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/korallis/Droidz/v3.1.3/install.sh | bash
```

---

## [3.1.2] - 2025-11-22

### 🔧 Hotfix

**Clean Installer - All Versions Synchronized**
- ✅ Removed tmux/jq/caffeinate dependency checks (not needed in v3.x)
- ✅ All version numbers synchronized: install.sh, package.json, README, tag
- ✅ Clean installation output without unnecessary dependency messages
- ✅ Tagged URL bypasses GitHub CDN cache
- ✅ Migration option available for v2.x users

**Installation command:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/korallis/Droidz/v3.1.2/install.sh | bash
```

---

## [3.1.1] - 2025-11-22

### 🔧 Hotfix

**Installation URL CDN Cache Bypass**
- ✅ Created v3.1.1 tag to force GitHub CDN cache invalidation
- ✅ Updated README to use tagged URL (`v3.1.1` instead of `main`)
- ✅ Ensures users get correct installer with v3.1.0 version and migration option
- ✅ No functional changes - just tag creation for reliable installation

**Why this matters:**
GitHub's `raw.githubusercontent.com` CDN aggressively caches files for 5-10 minutes.
Using a tagged version (`v3.1.1`) instead of branch (`main`) creates a new URL path
that bypasses all caching, ensuring users always get the updated installer.

**Updated installation command:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/korallis/Droidz/v3.1.1/install.sh | bash
```

## [2.7.6] - 2025-11-20

### ✅ Compliance

**Updated all skills to match Factory.ai official structure.**

#### Fixed Skill File Structure (Verified with Official Docs)
- ✅ All 61 skills now use official Factory.ai structure
- ✅ Removed 40 duplicate flat .md files
- ✅ All skills now in subdirectories with SKILL.md (uppercase)
- ✅ Verified against official Factory.ai documentation

**Official Factory.ai Structure:**
```
.factory/skills/{skill-name}/
└── SKILL.md  ← UPPERCASE (required)
```

**Source:** https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/skills/ai-data-analyst

**Problem:**
Mixed structure causing confusion:
- 21 skills had correct structure: `.factory/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- 40 skills were flat files: `.factory/skills/react.md`

**Root Cause:**
- Repository grew organically with inconsistent structures
- Some skills created with subdirectories, others as flat files
- Installer expected subdirectory structure

**Solution:**
- Researched official Factory.ai documentation via Exa and Ref tools
- Confirmed official structure: `.factory/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- Removed all 40 duplicate flat .md files from `.factory/skills/`
- All skills now in proper subdirectories

**Skills Updated:**
All 61 skills now follow official structure including:
- react, nextjs-16, typescript, prisma, tailwind-v4
- clerk, stripe, supabase, vercel, cloudflare-workers
- graphql-api-design, websocket-realtime, monitoring-observability
- And 48 more...

### 📊 Changes
- **Files removed:** 40 duplicate flat .md files
- **Structure:** 100% compliance with Factory.ai official docs
- **Consistency:** All 61 skills use {skill-name}/SKILL.md format

### 🎯 User Impact
**Before:** Mixed structures (subdirectories + flat files)  
**After:** Consistent official Factory.ai structure for all 61 skills

### 🔍 Verification Method
- Used Exa code context tool to research Factory.ai patterns
- Used Ref documentation search to find official docs
- Fetched official Factory.ai skill documentation
- Confirmed structure: `.factory/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

## [2.7.5] - 2025-11-20

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Fixed skill download failures reported by users.**

#### Fixed Missing Skills During Installation
- ✅ Renamed 12 skill files from lowercase to uppercase (skill.md → SKILL.md)
- ✅ Fixed: "Could not download [skill] skill (may not exist on remote yet)"
- ✅ All 61 skills now download successfully

**Problem:**
During installation, 12 skills showed warnings:
```
⚠ Could not download api-documentation-generator skill (may not exist on remote yet)
⚠ Could not download changelog-generator skill (may not exist on remote yet)
... (10 more skills)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Installer expects `SKILL.md` (uppercase)
- 12 skills had `skill.md` (lowercase)
- Git/GitHub URLs are case-sensitive

**Skills Fixed:**
1. api-documentation-generator
2. changelog-generator
3. ci-cd-pipelines
4. code-review-checklist
5. docker-containerization
6. environment-management
7. git-commit-messages
8. performance-profiler
9. pr-description-generator
10. readme-generator
11. security-audit-checklist
12. unit-test-generator

**Solution:**
- Renamed all 12 files to `SKILL.md` (uppercase)
- Now consistent with other 49 skills
- All skills download successfully on fresh install/update

### 📊 Changes
- **Files renamed:** 12 skill files (skill.md → SKILL.md)
- **Consistency:** All 61 skills now use `SKILL.md` format
- **User experience:** No more "may not exist" warnings

### 🎯 User Impact
**Before:** 12 skills failed to download during installation  
**After:** All 61 skills download successfully

## [2.7.4] - 2025-11-20

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Critical installer fixes reported by users.**

#### Fixed 404 Errors During Installation
- ✅ Updated droid filenames in installer (codegen.md → droidz-codegen.md)
- ✅ Added all 14 specialist droids to download list (was missing 8 new specialists)
- ✅ Fixed: "curl: (56) The requested URL returned error: 404"

**Before:** Tried to download old filenames (codegen.md, test.md, etc.)  
**After:** Downloads correct filenames (droidz-codegen.md, droidz-test.md, etc.)

#### Made jq and tmux Optional
- ✅ Changed from **required** to **optional** dependencies
- ✅ Clear messaging: "Droidz will work without these"
- ✅ Only needed for advanced orchestrator features
- ✅ Changed default from [Y/n] to [y/N] (defaults to skip)
- ✅ Installation continues successfully without them

**Why:** jq and tmux are only needed for advanced parallel orchestration features. Basic Droidz functionality works without them.

### 📊 Changes
- **Droids downloaded:** 7 → 14 (all specialists now included)
- **Dependencies:** jq/tmux now optional (was: required)
- **User experience:** Installation succeeds even without optional deps

### 🎯 User Impact
**Before:** Installation failed with 404 errors, required jq/tmux  
**After:** Installation succeeds, optional deps are truly optional

## [2.7.3] - 2025-11-20

### 🧹 Repository Cleanup

**Major cleanup to create a professional, easy-to-navigate repository.**

#### Removed User-Specific Content
- ✅ Removed `.droidz/` folder (user-generated specs, shouldn't be in framework repo)
- ✅ Removed `.claude/` folder (legacy Claude Code compatibility)
- ✅ Removed `config.yml` (user's personal config with API keys)
- ✅ Removed backup directories (`.factory-commands-backup-*`)
- ✅ Removed duplicate droid files (6 duplicate .md files)
- ✅ Removed unnecessary root files (AGENTS.md.template, SKILLS_SUMMARY.md, etc.)
- ✅ Removed test files (.factory/specs/active/todo-app-test.md)

#### Documentation Improvements
- ✅ Created `docs/REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md` - Complete explanation of every file/folder
- ✅ Updated README with v2.7.2 features (15 specialist droids, 61 skills, CLI auto-activation)
- ✅ Organized old docs into `docs/archive/` (11 historical planning docs)
- ✅ Simplified `.gitignore` - cleaner, more maintainable

#### Repository Structure
- ✅ Clean root with only 8 essential files
- ✅ Clear separation: framework code vs user content
- ✅ Professional organization for new users
- ✅ Active docs: INSTALLER_AUDIT.md, NEW_SKILLS_SUMMARY.md

#### What This Means
**Before:** Mixed framework files with developer's personal files (confusing)  
**After:** Framework repository contains ONLY framework code (clean!)

**Users get:**
- `.droidz/` folder created automatically by installer
- `config.yml` created by copying config.example.yml
- Clear understanding of what's framework vs personal content

### 📊 Final Stats
- **Removed:** 34 unnecessary files
- **Organized:** 11 docs moved to archive
