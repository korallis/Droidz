description: Start parallel orchestration with monitoring guidance
argument-hint: "task description"
---

Please run the parallel-watch helper command.

Execute: `.factory/commands/parallel-watch.sh $ARGUMENTS`

This helper script:
1. Explains the parallel orchestration workflow
2. Shows you what /parallel and /watch do
3. Guides you to use /watch for live monitoring

**Note:** For the best experience, use `/auto-parallel` instead - it provides
integrated guidance and clearer instructions for the workflow.

Example:
- `/parallel-watch "create REST API with 3 endpoints"`
