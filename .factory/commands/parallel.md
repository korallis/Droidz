description: One-command orchestration - analyzes request and executes in parallel
argument-hint: "task description"

I will orchestrate this task using parallel execution for maximum efficiency.

**Task:** $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Analyze and Break Down

I'll analyze the request to identify 3-5 discrete, parallelizable components. For each component, I'll determine:
- What can be done independently vs. sequentially
- Which specialist droid is best suited (droidz-codegen, droidz-test, droidz-refactor, droidz-integration, droidz-infra)
- Dependencies between tasks

## Step 2: Create Execution Plan

Using TodoWrite, I'll create a clear task list showing:
- Phase 1 tasks (can start immediately in parallel)
- Phase 2+ tasks (depend on earlier phases)
- Estimated time for each task
- Expected total time vs. sequential execution

## Step 3: Execute in Parallel

I'll use the Task tool to spawn specialist droids for each Phase 1 task simultaneously, achieving 3-5x faster execution.

## Step 4: Monitor Progress

I'll track completion and automatically spawn Phase 2 tasks when their dependencies complete.

Let me begin the analysis and orchestration now...
