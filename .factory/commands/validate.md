# Project Validation

⚠️ **This file is auto-generated by `/validate-init`**

Run `/validate-init` to generate a project-specific validation workflow.

## What Will Be Generated

After running `/validate-init`, this file will contain:

### Phase 1: Linting
- Auto-detects your linters (ESLint, Ruff, etc.)
- Generates appropriate lint commands

### Phase 2: Type Checking
- Auto-detects type checkers (TypeScript, Mypy)
- Adds type checking commands

### Phase 3: Style Checking
- Auto-detects formatters (Prettier, Black)
- Adds style validation

### Phase 4: Unit Tests
- Auto-detects test frameworks (Jest, Pytest)
- Generates test commands with coverage

### Phase 5: E2E Tests
- Detects E2E tools (Playwright, Cypress)
- Generates workflow-based E2E tests
- Sets up test environment (Docker if needed)

## Usage

```bash
# First time: Generate validation workflow
/validate-init

# Then: Run validation anytime
/validate
```

This placeholder will be replaced with your project-specific validation steps.
