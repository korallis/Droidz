description: Show active Droidz orchestration sessions
---

Please run the Droidz status command to show active orchestrations.

Execute: `.factory/commands/status.sh`

This will display:
- Active orchestration session IDs
- Number of tasks (completed, in-progress, pending, failed)
- Start times
- Quick action commands

If there are no active orchestrations, it will suggest starting one with `/parallel`.
